  abstract = {In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation
	of a custom-built wideband RF front-end for enabling dynamic spectrum
	access communications in software-defined radio platforms. The frontend
	is designed for wireless operation within the 50 MHz - 2.5 GHz frequency
	range, and is entirely software-controlled by the platform. Evaluation
	of the proposed design was conducted using the Universal Software
	Radio Peripheral (USRP) software defined radio platform and controlled
	via GNU Radio software. A prototype of the design was successfully
	demonstrated over a wide range of frequencies. Finally, several remaining
	design challenges are identified that would further enhance transmission
	performance.},
